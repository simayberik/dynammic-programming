# Hunting Lions Problem
This is an algorithm solving a spesific scenerio of a problem with dynammic and greedy approaches.
# Scenario of the Assignment:
A large family of lions is preparing for a hunt. Each lion in the family has hunting ability and this 
ability is scored between 0 and 100. In addition, this family has a criterion for those who will be 
chosen to go hunting; “No lion can go hunting with his/her immediate parent”. The reason for this 
is to ensure that there will be a lion (s) who will stay at home to protect their house. Lions will be 
selected so that the ‘total hunting ability’ should be maximum.
# Criterias:
Two criteria: 
1- No lion can go hunting with his/her immediate parent
2- Provide maximum ‘‘total hunting ability’ for the selected lion group

The aim is to maximize ‘total hunting ability’ with the given criterias.
The family hierarchy of lions is given in the "lions_hierarchy.txt"

Dynamic programming and greedy approach  identifies the optimal lion team , who 
should maximize the total hunting ability in this algorithm. There are two outputs for both approaches:
1. Total hunting ability value
2. The lions who should be selected to guarantee the maximum hunting ability value
